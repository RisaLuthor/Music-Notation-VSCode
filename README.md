# Music-Notation-VSCode
Created music using VSCode and ABC Music Notation

<br>

<br> Music Trial 1:
<br><p> A piece of music that I created using VSCode to construct the format and input the necessary information for the system to generate the sheet music and notation requried for the designated instrument.  Once the proper information was input into the system, the program showed a preview of the music, making it physical playable to instrumentalist. This specific piece is one that I wrote for myself about a friend.</p>
